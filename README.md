# Arduino Uno Sensor Shield

## Overview
This repository contains the design files for an Arduino Uno Sensor Shield developed as a college project. The shield allows for the simultaneous connection of six sensor modules to an Arduino Uno board, enhancing its functionality for various applications.

## Sensor Modules
The shield supports the following sensor modules:
1. IR Sensor
2. pH Sensor
3. Ultrasonic Sensor
4. Temperature Sensor
5. LCD Module
6. Touch Sensor

## Software Used
The design of the Arduino Uno Sensor Shield was created using KiCad, an open-source electronic design automation (EDA) software suite. KiCad provides a powerful platform for schematic capture, PCB layout, and design rule checking.

## Repository Contents
- `schematic`: Contains the schematic files for the Arduino Uno Sensor Shield.
- `pcb_layout`: Includes the PCB layout files for the shield design.
- `gerber_files`: Contains the Gerber files necessary for PCB fabrication.
- `3d_models`: Includes 3D models of the shield for visualization purposes.

## How to Use
To use the Arduino Uno Sensor Shield:
1. Download the design files from this repository.
2. Open the schematic and PCB layout files in KiCad.
3. Review the design and make any necessary modifications.
4. Generate Gerber files for PCB fabrication.
5. Fabricate the PCB and assemble the components according to the provided layout.
6. Connect the Arduino Uno board to the sensor shield.
7. Connect the desired sensor modules to the shield's headers.
8. Upload the appropriate firmware to the Arduino Uno board.
9. Test the functionality of the sensor shield with the connected sensor modules.
